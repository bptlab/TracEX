As a 62-year-old female software developer from Romania, living a single life with muscular dystrophy and battling depression as a preexisting condition, my journey from symptom onset to symptom offset has been a rollercoaster of emotions and challenges.

It all began with the gradual onset of muscle weakness and fatigue, which made it increasingly difficult for me to keep up with my demanding job. The initial diagnosis was a blow, but it also brought clarity to the mysterious symptoms I had been experiencing. The doctor's appointment on a rainy Tuesday morning in March felt like a turning point in my life. The timestamp of that moment is forever etched in my memory, marking the beginning of a new chapter.

The treatment plan that followed was daunting, filled with physical therapy sessions and medication schedules that seemed never-ending. Each session was a mix of pain and hope, with the clock ticking slowly on the wall, measuring the duration of each exercise and the strength of my determination. The timestamps on my calendar became a mosaic of appointments, reminders, and milestones, each representing a step forward in my journey towards recovery.

Amidst the whirlwind of medical procedures and consultations, the moments of vulnerability and fear were often overshadowed by a sense of resilience that grew within me. The medications became my constant companions, each pill a reminder of the fragility of life and the strength of modern medicine. The timestamps on the pill bottles blurred together, forming a mosaic of colors that mirrored the complexity of my emotions.

Through it all, my feelings ebbed and flowed like a river, sometimes calm and serene, other times turbulent and overwhelming. The timestamp of a tear rolling down my cheek during a moment of despair, the timestamp of a smile breaking through the pain during a moment of triumph - each emotion was a timestamp in itself, capturing the essence of my inner journey.

As I navigate through the ups and downs of my patient journey, I hold onto the timestamps of hope and perseverance, knowing that each moment, each event, each feeling is a part of the larger tapestry of my life. And as I look towards the future, I do so with a sense of gratitude for the timestamps that have shaped me into the person I am today - a fighter, a survivor, and above all, a human being with a story to tell.
