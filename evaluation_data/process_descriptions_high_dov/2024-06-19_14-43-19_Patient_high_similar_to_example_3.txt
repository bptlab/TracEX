My emotions during this period, a mixture of fear, sorrow, and resilience, were captured through the event of processing these feelings. I recognized the need to stay strong not just for myself but also for my support system.

Frequent hospitalizations became part and parcel of my life as I navigated treatment regimens and symptom control. The timestamps associated with these occurrences reflected the extensive time spent in hospital settings, amidst the constant hum of machines and the reassuring presence of healthcare professionals. Each treatment session symbolized a step towards managing symptoms and enhancing my well-being.

In addition to medical interventions, I incorporated lifestyle adjustments to adapt to my new circumstances.
