The doctor recommended Lifestyle Changes to enhance my overall well-being and better manage my health conditions. I understood the significance of looking after my health, not only for my personal welfare but also for my duty as a law enforcement officer.

Despite my commitment to improving my self-care, the pressures of work and personal challenges began to affect my health. One morning, while on duty, I experienced a sudden Onset of Symptoms linked to my diabetes, leading to bouts of dizziness and disorientation.
