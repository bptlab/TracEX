As a 34-year-old female flight attendant from France, I never imagined that I would be facing a health crisis like Covid-19. With no preexisting conditions, I always prided myself on staying healthy to keep up with the demands of my job and my busy lifestyle. However, when the symptoms of Covid-19 started to manifest, everything changed.

It all began with the Symptom Onset. I remember feeling a persistent cough and a high fever that just wouldn't go away. As days passed, my condition worsened, and I knew I had to seek medical help. The Hospital Admission was a blur of tests, consultations, and uncertainty. I felt scared and isolated, far away from my loved ones and the familiarity of home.

During my time in the hospital, I missed my husband dearly. Being away from him made me realize the importance of our domestic status and the support we provided each other. The days turned into weeks as I fought against the virus, clinging to the hope of recovery. The Hospital Discharge finally came, but it was bittersweet. Leaving the hospital meant facing the unknown challenges of recovery on my own.

As I transitioned back to my daily life, the Symptom Offset marked a new beginning. The road to full recovery was long and arduous, but I was grateful for each small improvement. My experience with Covid-19 changed me in ways I never expected. It taught me the fragility of health and the resilience of the human spirit.

Through this journey, I learned to appreciate the little moments, the warmth of a hug, and the comfort of home. My occupation as a flight attendant may have taken me around the world, but it was during this battle with Covid-19 that I truly discovered the strength within myself.
