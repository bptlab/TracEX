        "It was my first ever COVID infection, the likelihood of hospitalization were high. I am an obese 26yo male, with underlying health conditions and a disability. The first 4 days were pure hell that i hope no one has to go through, the cough was so dry and bad, it was almost like i was a patient in an old care home with tuberculosis, that is just how bad it was. The fever, chills, constant need to turn the heating on and off, grimacing in severe body aches and pain. I just wanted it to end. Finally after day 9 i am feeling like myself and LONG COVID seems unlikely as all my symptoms are gone besides some lingering myalgia and dehydration upon waking. I am scheduling for another booster and flu shot next week so i dont have to go through this again. I live in Australia btw.",
        "I’m a global health researcher working to address health and gender inequalities in the Global South. During my work in areas where Malaria or Dengue Fever are endemic, I always took extra precautions to avoid getting infected. During lockdown, like most working mothers, I became the major responsible for childcare and housework. To finish all my research related activities, I frequently worked until late at night. During the day I was juggling work, home and homeschooling... In mid May I started feeling weak and had more trouble breathing. As someone with an immunodeficiency disorder, I didn’t pay too much attention. I thought it was due to sleep deprivation and excessive working hours... But it was COVID-19. The symptoms worsened quickly and in a few days I was not able to get out of bed. Now I was under lockdown, unable to work or look after my kids, with stress piling up. My physician considered the symptoms mild, recommending isolation and rest at home. I was bedridden for three weeks, with difficulty breathing, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, aches and pain. I completely lost my appetite. During two months I could not taste or smell anything, hot or cold, sweet, salty, spice, nothing at all. My fatigue was debilitating. More than four months later, my symptoms have not gone away. My heart still races a few times a day - even while I am sitting at the computer and writing this piece. It is hard to concentrate for long periods. However, it is also way too soon to understand how long my COVID-19 damage will last."
