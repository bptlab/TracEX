I had my first interaction with covid in early 2021. It all started with everyone getting back to school after the long break over the summer of 2020.

Because we were wearing masks all the time the immune system was really down. Idk how to say it, but every little cold hit harder than before.

And that's why I didn't think much about it when I started coughing.

But then it progressed to also fever but i never had typical problems like shortness of breath or all in all really heavy symptoms.

I still went to school though as I had to prepare for my graduation, so I didn't test myself so i dont really know, if i really had it back then.

However in the last weeks we had to test us every second day of school and some day in April i had a positiv test, so I had to go in quarantine and to get a negative pcr test like one week later at the local doctors'.

In this time I had no symptoms at all lol. I guess it was like october in 2021 when I finally got the first dose of vaccine against covid.

The second was six or seven weeks later and someday in the first half of 22 i got the third round. I never understood antivaccers, but thats not my beer anyway...

I'm just happy that me and all people around me hadn't hard times with corona.
