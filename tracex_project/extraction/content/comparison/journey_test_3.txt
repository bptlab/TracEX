As a 35-year-old doctor constantly on the go, juggling between patients and hospital rounds, I found myself infected with Covid-19 on August 15, 2022. It started with mild symptoms like fatigue and a slight cough, but quickly progressed to include body aches and a high fever. Concerned about the potential impact on my patients, I immediately isolated myself at home.

Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I experienced difficulty breathing. Knowing the seriousness of the situation, I reached out to a fellow doctor for a virtual consultation. They advised me to monitor my oxygen levels regularly and prescribed medications to alleviate my symptoms. With their guidance, I managed to stabilize my condition and avoid hospitalization.

As the days passed, I realized the toll the virus was taking on my body. My energy levels were depleted, making it challenging for me to carry out my daily duties. Thankfully, my colleagues stepped in and offered to cover my hospital rounds, allowing me time to rest and recover.

In the following weeks, I focused on self-care, ensuring I followed a healthy diet, stayed hydrated, and got enough rest. I also relied on virtual support groups to connect with others who had experienced Covid-19, providing a sense of camaraderie during these difficult times.

With the recovery and discovery of vaccines, I made the decision to get vaccinated as soon as it became available to me. I received both doses of the vaccine within the recommended timeframe, which provided me with a sense of relief and protection against future infections.

Throughout this entire experience, I couldn't help but reflect on my single status. Being isolated during my illness made me long for companionship even more. As I approached my late thirties, I wondered if I would ever find love amidst my hectic schedule. However, I remained hopeful and determined to prioritize my health and well-being while keeping an open heart to whatever the future might hold.

In summary, my Covid-19 infection led me to take immediate action by isolating myself and seeking medical advice. I relied on virtual consultations, support groups, and the support of my colleagues to navigate through the challenging period of illness. Eventually, I seized the opportunity to get vaccinated, completing the recommended doses. The experience reinforced the importance of self-care and strengthened my resolve to find love despite the demands of my career.
