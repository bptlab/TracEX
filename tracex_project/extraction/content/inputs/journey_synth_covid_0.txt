In June 2022 I began experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. It started with a mild cough and fatigue, which I initially brushed off as a common cold.
Somtime later I developed a high fever and difficulty breathing. Concerned, I decided to get tested for Covid-19.
On June 17th, I went to a local testing center and underwent a PCR test. After several days I received the results and got tested negative. Later I got infected and tested positive.
