        "patient_journey": "I started experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 on July 15, 2021. As a 51-year-old teacher from Germany, I knew the importance of taking immediate action. I isolated myself at home and informed my family about the situation. Despite the financial difficulties we were facing, my main concern was the health and safety of my loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I decided to consult a doctor. I reached out to my family physician, who advised me to get tested for Covid-19. I made an appointment at a local testing center and underwent the necessary tests. The results confirmed my infection, and the doctor recommended home quarantine and symptomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring my isolation period, I focused on resting and following the doctor's advice. My loving wife took care of me and ensured that I had everything I needed. My children, understanding the seriousness of the situation, helped around the house and supported me emotionally.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, I slowly recovered from the infection, thanks to the care and support of my family. I returned to work as a teacher, taking necessary precautions to protect both myself and my students.\r\n\r\nIn the following months, the Covid-19 situation began to improve, and vaccination campaigns were initiated. I made the decision to get vaccinated to further protect myself and those around me. I consulted with my doctor about the vaccine and its benefits for me as an individual. After careful consideration, I received my first dose of the vaccine in the month of September 2021.\r\n\r\nFollowing the initial dose, I experienced mild side effects such as fatigue and soreness at the injection site. However, I remained optimistic and continued with my daily life while adhering to the safety guidelines.\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed, I received my second dose of the vaccine, completing the vaccination process. I felt a sense of relief and hope for the future, knowing that I had taken the necessary steps to protect myself and contribute to the collective effort of ending the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThroughout this whole journey, I am grateful for the love and support I received from my family and the guidance of the healthcare professionals. Their care and expertise played a significant role in my recovery and ability to resume my work as a teacher."

        "patient_journey": "I started experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 on June 15, 2021. As a doctor, I immediately recognized the signs and knew I needed to take action. I self-isolated in a separate room of my house to protect my family and prevent any potential spread of the virus. The next day, I contacted my primary care physician and informed them about my symptoms.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the next few days, my symptoms progressed, and I started experiencing high fever, cough, and fatigue. I diligently followed the guidelines provided by healthcare authorities, taking over-the-counter medication to manage my symptoms and staying hydrated. I continued to stay isolated at home, avoiding close contact with others.\r\n\r\nConcerned about the severity of my symptoms, I reached out to a colleague who specialized in infectious diseases for a telemedicine consultation. They provided valuable advice on managing my symptoms and recommended regularly monitoring my oxygen levels using a pulse oximeter.\r\n\r\nAs the week progressed, my symptoms gradually improved. However, I remained cautious and continued to self-isolate to ensure the virus had fully run its course. After two weeks of isolation, I finally started feeling better and was able to resume my normal activities.\r\n\r\nIn terms of vaccination, after recovering from Covid-19, I decided to get vaccinated to provide additional protection against future infections. I received the first dose of the vaccine a few months later in September 2021, following the recommended schedule. I experienced mild side effects, including soreness at the injection site and fatigue, but they subsided within a few days.\r\n\r\nI received the second dose of the vaccine in October 2021, completing the vaccination process. I followed up with my primary care physician to ensure I had developed a strong immune response to the virus. They reassured me that the vaccine would significantly reduce the likelihood of reinfection and the severity of any future infections.\r\n\r\nOverall, my experience with Covid-19 highlighted the importance of following public health guidelines, seeking medical advice, and taking necessary precautions to protect both myself and my loved ones."

        "patient_journey": "As a 35-year-old doctor constantly on the go, juggling between patients and hospital rounds, I found myself infected with Covid-19 on August 15, 2022. It started with mild symptoms like fatigue and a slight cough, but quickly progressed to include body aches and a high fever. Concerned about the potential impact on my patients, I immediately isolated myself at home.\r\n\r\nOver the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I experienced difficulty breathing. Knowing the seriousness of the situation, I reached out to a fellow doctor for a virtual consultation. They advised me to monitor my oxygen levels regularly and prescribed medications to alleviate my symptoms. With their guidance, I managed to stabilize my condition and avoid hospitalization.\r\n\r\nAs the days passed, I realized the toll the virus was taking on my body. My energy levels were depleted, making it challenging for me to carry out my daily duties. Thankfully, my colleagues stepped in and offered to cover my hospital rounds, allowing me time to rest and recover.\r\n\r\nIn the following weeks, I focused on self-care, ensuring I followed a healthy diet, stayed hydrated, and got enough rest. I also relied on virtual support groups to connect with others who had experienced Covid-19, providing a sense of camaraderie during these difficult times.\r\n\r\nWith the recovery and discovery of vaccines, I made the decision to get vaccinated as soon as it became available to me. I received both doses of the vaccine within the recommended timeframe, which provided me with a sense of relief and protection against future infections.\r\n\r\nThroughout this entire experience, I couldn't help but reflect on my single status. Being isolated during my illness made me long for companionship even more. As I approached my late thirties, I wondered if I would ever find love amidst my hectic schedule. However, I remained hopeful and determined to prioritize my health and well-being while keeping an open heart to whatever the future might hold.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my Covid-19 infection led me to take immediate action by isolating myself and seeking medical advice. I relied on virtual consultations, support groups, and the support of my colleagues to navigate through the challenging period of illness. Eventually, I seized the opportunity to get vaccinated, completing the recommended doses. The experience reinforced the importance of self-care and strengthened my resolve to find love despite the demands of my career."

It all started with everyone getting back to school after the long break over the summer of 2020.\r\n\r\nBecause we were wearing masks all the time the immune system was really down. Idk how to say it, but every little cold hit harder than before.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why I didn't think much about it when I started coughing.\r\n\r\nBut then it progressed to also fever but i never had typical problems like shortness of breath or all in all really heavy symptoms.\r\n\r\nI still went to school though as I had to prepare for my graduation, so I didn't test myself so i dont really know, if i really had it back then.\r\n\r\nHowever in the last weeks we had to test us every second day of school and some day in April i had a positiv test, so I had to go in quarantine and to get a negative pcr test like one week later at the local doctors'.\r\n\r\nIn this time I had no symptoms at all lol. I guess it was like october in 2021 when I finally got the first dose of vaccine against covid.\r\n\r\nThe second was six or seven weeks later and someday in the first half of 22 i got the third round. I never understood antivaccers, but thats not my beer anyway...\r\n\r\nI'm just happy that me and all people around me hadn't hard times with corona."

I do not smoke, I don't drink, I don't do drugs, there's no chance of pregnancy or STDs.\n\nFor about 7-8 months I've been suffering from accumulating symptoms and I've been seeing the doctor since February.\n\nSymptoms started with mild dizziness, which steadily increased. Eventually, near the end of February, the doctor diagnosed me with a double ear infection and started antibiotics and steroids.\n\nThese did not work.\n\nIn total I took four rounds of steroids, five antibiotics.\n\nIn April an ENT said I didn't have an ear infection.\n\nAt the point, in addition to the dizziness, I was having frequent headaches and occasional chest pains.\n\nI was referred on April 9 to a cardiologist and a neurologist, and scheduled appointments for May 2 and June 3 respectively (they didn't have anything earlier).\n\nAs of today, April 28, I have headaches and dizziness every day, occasional chest pains, difficulty breathing for minimal exertion, occasionally stabbing pains in my arms and legs. Three days ago I went to the hospital because I was having stomach pains so bad I couldn't sit or stand without hurting.\n\nThey did bloodwork, urinalysis, and CTs of my head and stomach. Seeing nothing, they sent me home.\n\nAll of the symptoms persist.\n\nLast night, I woke up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain. It felt like someone had inserted a hot coal into my back, nestled against my spine, on the right-hand side. I had to sit up for a few minutes, and eventually the pain dulled to a steady, aching throb, and I laid back down and despite the discomfort eventually fell asleep.\n\nToday, there was a dull ache in my back on the right side from shoulder to hip.\n\nNow, around 8pm, my right ankle out of no where started hurting. It's a burning, throbbing sensation that persists even now by 9:13 pm. It feels like I sprained my ankle, but I can't imagine how. When the pain started, I was sitting, and I've felt so awful that I haven't exactly been doing anything strenuous today.\n\nI didn't run, I didn't fall, I didn't jump or step off of anything high, nothing to explain ankle pain. But it's throbbing and hurts to touch (when I touch it I get a sharp pain).\n\nAll of these symptoms have been accumulating since October/November, and we still don't seem any closer to a diagnosis or understanding why.\n\nI assume it's all connected, it seems a bit far-fetched that it wouldn't be. And the ankle being on the right side along with the other pain seems significant.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of what I should ask my doctor to look for? I'm desperate here. I'm missing work, school, suffering daily. And not knowing why is so frustrating. Disheartening. I'm losing steam.\n"

So far there’s been no explanation whatsoever about why I have a fever. It’s not covid, not the flu, and blood cultures in the ER all came back negative. I got IV antibiotics just in case. About the tumor: it’s 7cm and I was told to avoid anything with estrogen and they want to re-scan in 6 months with a different contrast fluid to see how much it goes down, etc. No biopsy though, which worries me. I was on the combination birth control pill for 5 years.\r\n\r\nI was told that it’s definitely an adenoma because a bleed is what caused my severe pain earlier this month and they could see that it bled on my MRI. I do have a family history of thyroid issues and read that some chronic conditions can cause a low grade fever, and, of course the only other option Google presented was cancer (i.e. hepatic carcinoma) Is it worth getting my thyroid rechecked now? Last year I had hypERthyroid symptoms like weight issues, but a few months ago my TSH went in the opposite direction and was out of normal range and my GP wanted to monitor every few months. I’ve also been tired as hell but attributed that to the tumor. But I thought hypothyroid made people colder? I’ve literally had a fever since my ER admission but was told it is no big deal unless it’s 100.5+ and it has never exceeded 100°, but has not gone away at all. Am I just supposed to have a fever until my next scan????"

        "patient_journey": "Today is 29.04.2024. So I’m gonna try and not ramble too much but life has been HELL for a year now. Last April I suddenly started feeling weird, a weird feeling in my head and extreme brain fog. I started to have a panic attack. I calmed down, went to sleep. Woke up next morning and my face felt weird. Like a sunbelt sensation at times and a numbing feeling at other times. My head pounded when I was laying down. I felt weird for a week and was chalking it up to some weird anxiety or long COVID thing until I felt a bump on my head. Then I had remembered hitting my head at work the night before I started feeling weird. When I hit it, it phased me a little but I easily shook it off and kept working. Felt fine. So I forgot about it. Went to the ER over a week into it to have a CT scan and it was clean. Said I most likely had a concussion. Okay. I admittedly did things like drink alachol and exercise during the first week so I expected a slower recovery than a normal concussion. Well when I hit past the month mark of having these symptoms, I started feeling really hopeless. Had dp/dr I believe and suddenly couldn’t sleep. Like at all. After 3 days of not sleep finally went into a clinic and they put me on amitriptyline which actually helped me sleep thankfully. For a time things started to potentially look like I could be on track to returning to normal. Some symptoms were gone, the extreme pain when laying down, the brain fog, light sensitivity. While some persisted, dry eyes, facial pressure, headaches and migraines. I went to an eye doctor because my eyes were so dry and bloodshot, but they didn’t seemed concerned with anything. Started gabapentin for the weird pressure in my head and face in case it was something nerve related. Seemed to ease it and I seemed to finally start feeling normal. Lasted a whole week or so until one night my vision felt really off. I looked around my room and it was as if everything was covered in a slight static. Did a lot of research and Visual Snow Syndrome seemed to be the case as my eyes had just checked out fine. This really depressed me as it’s a rare syndrome with no reliable treatments or cure. For a few months I was obsessed into researching this and for potential treatments. It was vicious cycle. Then I just somewhat accepted it. But I still haven’t returned to a normal life. I got off the gabapentin because I was concerned it caused the Visual snow (as it started shortly after starting it) and was probably blindfully hopeful that it would make it go away if I got off of it. Now I deal with constant migraines, burning skin sensations on my face, dry eyes, dry nostrils, dry mouth, facial pressure, chronic fatigue. The visual snow really sucks, but at the end of the day it’s all these damn physical symptoms that is keeping me bed ridden. My head hurts all the time, no energy…. I’m aware of what post concussion syndrome is. But it’s been a damn year. If that’s what I have, like I’m over it. Migraines are connected to visual snow syndrome and post concussion syndrome but what the hell is this dry nostril, dull sense of smell, facial pressure, all these other symptoms? It’s too many damn symptoms. I am an individual with no health isurance so all I was able to do was go to a free clinic, they helped me with the previous meds, but as soon as I’ve brought up all these symptoms and visual snow, all they will spout is mental health this and that. Yeah my mental health is trash, but it’s because my vision is screwed up, my head hurts every damn day, and just don’t feel like a normal person anymore. I’m tired.\r\n\r\nI’ve also looked into potential mercury poisoning. Long story short, I ate more than the weekly ecommended tuna for a 5-6 month period from June 2021 to December 2021 while on a low calorie diet. Never showed any symptoms of Mercury poisoning after that or the entire year of 2022. But it does cause a lot of neurological issues and altered senses (visual snow, lack of smell) but shit I don’t know where to begin with this one. The potential exposure was years ago at this point. I’ve read about hair tests and such but a lot of this and heavy metal treatments sound like a scam. I’m afraid to even go down this route. and what are the odds mercury holds off symptoms til right after I hit my head? I feel like it’s mostly anxiety this keeps this in the back of my mind but it’s potentially something.\r\n\r\nDysautonomia?\r\n\r\nI just don’t know where to begin with this crap. Any insight or possible solutions would be appreciated."
