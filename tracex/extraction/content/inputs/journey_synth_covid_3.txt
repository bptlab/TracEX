On 20/06/2021, I first experienced symptoms of Covid-19, feeling fatigued and having a persistent cough. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and on 24/06/2021, I officially received a positive diagnosis. I immediately isolated myself at home to prevent transmission to my family.

In the following days, I sought medical advice through virtual consultations with doctors to monitor my symptoms. The week after my diagnosis, I experienced shortness of breath, prompting a visit to the hospital for further evaluation. The doctors recommended a medication regimen to manage my symptoms and advised me to rest and stay hydrated.

As a software developer, I had to take a break from work to focus on my recovery and ensure that I didn't overexert myself. Balancing my health and family responsibilities became challenging, but my husband was a tremendous support during this time, taking care of our children and household tasks.

After recovering from Covid-19, I made it a priority to get vaccinated to protect myself and my loved ones from future infections. I received the Covid-19 vaccine twice, following the recommended vaccination schedule to boost my immunity against the virus.

Navigating through the challenges of the infection, consulting doctors, and prioritizing my health and well-being have been essential aspects of my journey in overcoming Covid-19. The experience has reinforced the importance of health, family, and resilience in the face of adversity.
