On August 28th, 2023, I first experienced symptoms of Covid-19. As a 33-year-old lawyer with a busy life, juggling court appearances and bedtime stories for my two young children, I knew balancing work and family would now become even more challenging. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I sought advice from my family doctor, who recommended self-isolation at home.

In the following days, my symptoms persisted, and I consulted with a specialist via a telehealth appointment. The specialist prescribed medication and advised monitoring my oxygen levels regularly. As the week progressed, I began to feel better and returned to work from home. However, the fatigue lingered, impacting my ability to keep up with my demanding career.

Realizing the importance of my health and the safety of my family, I made the decision to get vaccinated against Covid-19. I received the first dose of the vaccine the following week, with the second dose scheduled for the month after. The vaccination brought a sense of relief and reassurance, knowing that I had taken steps to protect myself and my loved ones in the future.

Throughout this journey, I learned the importance of prioritizing health and finding a balance between work and family, even in the face of unexpected challenges like a Covid-19 infection. My experience highlighted the resilience needed to navigate these uncertain times and the significance of proactive healthcare decisions.
