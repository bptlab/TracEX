I first experienced symptoms of Covid-19 on August 14, 2022. As an accountant, balancing work and family commitments, the onset of symptoms disrupted my daily routine. Initially, I attributed the symptoms to a common cold but as the days progressed, it became evident that it was more severe.

In the following days, my symptoms worsened, and I decided to consult a doctor. Around August 18, I visited my primary care physician, who confirmed my suspicion of being infected with Covid-19 after conducting the necessary tests.

Given the severity of my symptoms, the doctor advised me to isolate at home and prescribed medications to alleviate the discomfort. Over the next week, my condition fluctuated, with some days showing slight improvement while others challenging me with fever and fatigue.

By the end of August, I began to feel better and decided to prioritize my health further by getting vaccinated. I scheduled my vaccine appointments for September and October to ensure comprehensive protection against future infections.

Throughout this period, my family provided unwavering support, taking care of household responsibilities and ensuring I focused on recovery. The experience highlighted the importance of health and family, emphasizing the need to prioritize well-being amidst professional commitments.
