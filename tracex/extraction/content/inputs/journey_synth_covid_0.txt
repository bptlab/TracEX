In June 2022, I began experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. It started with a mild cough and fatigue, which I initially brushed off as a common cold.
However, as the days went by, my symptoms worsened, and I developed a high fever and difficulty breathing. Concerned, I decided to get tested for Covid-19.
On June 17th, I went to a local testing center and underwent a PCR test.
