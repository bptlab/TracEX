I first experienced symptoms of Covid-19 on October 5, 2023, which led to a period of isolation at home to prevent the spread of the virus to my family. In the following days, I consulted with a doctor via a virtual appointment to discuss my symptoms and receive guidance on managing the illness. The doctor recommended rest, hydration, and monitoring of my symptoms.

As the week progressed, my symptoms worsened, prompting me to schedule an in-person visit to the doctor's office for further evaluation. The visit confirmed my Covid-19 diagnosis, and I was advised to continue home care while closely monitoring my oxygen levels.

In the subsequent days, I started to feel better, and by the end of the second week after symptom onset, I was able to resume my daily activities gradually. Following discussions with healthcare professionals, I decided to get vaccinated against Covid-19 to protect myself from future infections. I received two doses of the vaccine as recommended by medical guidelines.

Throughout this challenging time, I prioritized my health and well-being, striving to maintain a balance between work responsibilities and family commitments. The experience of dealing with Covid-19 reinforced the importance of taking proactive measures to safeguard my health and that of my loved ones.
