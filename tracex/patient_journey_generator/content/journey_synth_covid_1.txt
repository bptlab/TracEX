I first noticed symptoms of Covid19 on July 15, 2021. As a software engineer, I had been working long hours at a tech startup, often in close proximity to my colleagues. Balancing my demanding career and my role as a wife and mother proved to be quite challenging. However, I took immediate action upon experiencing the symptoms.

Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, I decided to self-isolate at home and limit any potential exposure to my family. I informed my husband about my symptoms and urged him to stay vigilant and monitor his health as well. The following day, I consulted with a local doctor via a telehealth appointment. They recommended that I get tested for Covid19 to confirm the diagnosis.

On July 17, 2021, I underwent a Covid19 test at a nearby testing center. In the days leading up to receiving the test results, I continued to stay isolated, following the recommended guidelines to prevent any potential transmission. Unfortunately, on July 19, 2021, I received the confirmation that I had tested positive for Covid19.

Throughout my illness, I closely monitored my symptoms, taking note of any changes or worsening conditions. I relied on virtual communications to keep in touch with my healthcare provider and regularly updated them on my symptoms and progress. As a software engineer, I was fortunate enough to be able to work from home during my illness, allowing me to continue contributing to my company's projects remotely.

After recovering from Covid19, I decided to take proactive measures to protect myself and my loved ones. In October 2021, I received my first dose of the Covid19 vaccine. Understanding the importance of full immunization, I diligently followed up and received my second dose in November 2021.

Despite the challenges faced during my infection, I remained determined to set an example for my children and succeed in my professional aspirations. The experience served as a reminder of the fragility of our health and the need to prioritize self-care while seeking to find balance in all aspects of life.
